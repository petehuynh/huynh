## Usage

### Basic Initialization

Integrate _Huynh_ into your React project with minimal configuration:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { initializeCopyAnalytics } from 'huynh';

initializeCopyAnalytics({
  analyticsProvider: 'gtag', // or your custom provider
  copyReplacementRulesPath: './config/copyReplacementRules.json',
  abTestingEnabled: true,
  budget: {
    monthlyLimitUSD: 1000,
    thresholds: [80, 90],
    notificationEmails: ['admin@example.com']
  },
  goals: {
    conversionRate: {
      threshold: 2.5,
      operator: '<',
      action: 'refineCopy'
    },
    bounceRate: {
      threshold: 50,
      operator: '>',
      action: 'refineCopy'
    }
  }
});
```

### Using Pre-built UI Components

Enhance your interfaces while capturing analytics and A/B test data effortlessly:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ButtonWithAnalytics from 'huynh/ui/ButtonWithAnalytics';
import ABTestWrapper from 'huynh/ui/ABTestWrapper';

export function LandingCTA() {
  return (
    <ABTestWrapper
      testId="landing-cta"
      controlText="Get Started"
      variantText="Master Your Investments Today"
    >
      {(selectedText: string) => (
        <ButtonWithAnalytics 
          label={selectedText} 
          onClick={() => {
            // handle click and track analytics event
          }}
        />
      )}
    </ABTestWrapper>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

Customize the package to suit your project’s needs:

- **Copy Replacement Rules:**  
  Edit `copyReplacementRules.json` to define your text mapping and benefit-driven messaging.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Manage API keys and sensitive data using a `.env` file. Example:

  ```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
  AI_PROVIDER=openai  # or 'anthropic'
  COPY_REPLACEMENT_RULES_PATH=./config/copyReplacementRules.json
  GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-ga-measurement-id
  ```

- **Advanced Options:**  
  Modify configurations for budgeting, trigger actions, and A/B testing parameters within the initialization object.
